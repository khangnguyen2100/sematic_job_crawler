## 🚀 HIGH PRIORITY - Core Missing Features

### 1. **Real Crawler Implementations** ⚠️ CRITICAL
Currently only TopCV has a real implementation using Playwright. Others are mock implementations.

#### ✅ **TopCV Crawler** - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Advanced TopCV Playwright crawler** (fully functional with real data)
- ✅ **Enhanced anti-bot measures** with Cloudflare challenge bypass
- ✅ **Stealth patches** to hide automation traces
- ✅ **Rate limiting and error handling** 
- ✅ **Multiple bypass methods** (FlareSolverr, Cloudscraper, human challenge)
- ✅ **Real job data extraction** with 200+ jobs actively crawled
- ✅ **Configuration management** via `topcv_config.py`

#### ITViec Crawler (Priority 1)
- [ ] Create `app/config/itviec_config.py` (similar to TopCV config)
- [ ] Implement real Playwright-based `ITViecCrawler` in `job_crawlers.py`
- [ ] Add ITViec-specific selectors and parsing logic
- [ ] Test with `test_itviec_integration.py` script
- [ ] Handle ITViec's job listing structure and pagination
