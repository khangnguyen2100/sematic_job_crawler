# TODO - Semantic Job Search Platform

## üéØ Project Status Summary
**Status**: ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY** - All critical issues resolved, core functionality working

This is a semantic job search platform with React/TypeScript frontend, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database, and Marqo vector search. The system is fully operational with working TopCV crawler, semantic search, admin dashboard, and user interfaces.

**Last Updated**: August 5, 2025

## üöÄ HIGH PRIORITY - Core Missing Features

### 1. **Real Crawler Implementations** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
Currently only TopCV has a real implementation using Playwright. Others are mock implementations.

#### ITViec Crawler (Priority 1)
- [ ] Create `app/config/itviec_config.py` (similar to TopCV config)
- [ ] Implement real Playwright-based `ITViecCrawler` in `job_crawlers.py`
- [ ] Add ITViec-specific selectors and parsing logic
- [ ] Test with `test_itviec_integration.py` script
- [ ] Handle ITViec's job listing structure and pagination

#### VietnamWorks Crawler (Priority 2)
- [ ] Create `app/config/vietnamworks_config.py`
- [ ] Implement real Playwright-based `VietnamWorksCrawler`
- [ ] Handle their job listing structure and pagination
- [ ] Add rate limiting and error handling
- [ ] Test with dedicated integration script

#### LinkedIn Jobs Crawler (Priority 3) ‚ö†Ô∏è COMPLEX
- [ ] Research LinkedIn's anti-bot measures and terms of service
- [ ] Consider using LinkedIn Jobs API instead of scraping
- [ ] Implement authentication handling if needed
- [ ] Add robust error handling for rate limits
- [ ] Evaluate legal and technical feasibility

### 2. **Advanced Duplicate Detection** üîß ENHANCEMENT
Current system only does basic Marqo similarity check.

- [ ] Enhance `SimpleDuplicateChecker` with content hashing
- [ ] Add fuzzy string matching for company names/titles
- [ ] Implement job similarity threshold configuration
- [ ] Add deduplication statistics to admin dashboard
- [ ] Test with real duplicate job scenarios
- [ ] Add manual duplicate review interface

### 3. **Production Backend Issues** üêõ FIXES NEEDED
Small remaining issues identified:

- [ ] Fix crawl log statistics endpoint (500 server error)
- [ ] Improve empty search validation handling
- [ ] Correct HTTP status codes (authentication should return 401 not 403)
- [ ] Add structured logging for production monitoring
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error tracking
