    ## Semantic Job Search
    
    Perform AI-powered semantic search across all job postings using vector embeddings.
    
    ### How it works:
    - Uses transformer models to understand job queries semantically
    - Searches job titles, descriptions, and company names
    - Returns results ranked by semantic similarity
    
    ### Query Examples:
    ```
    "Python developer with machine learning experience"
    "Frontend React developer remote work"
    "Senior backend engineer fintech startup"
    "Data scientist AI computer vision"
    ```
    
    ### Features:
    - **Semantic matching**: Finds relevant jobs even without exact keyword matches
    - **Source filtering**: Filter by specific job platforms (LinkedIn, TopCV, etc.)
    - **Pagination**: Control result limits and offsets
    - **Analytics tracking**: All searches are automatically tracked
